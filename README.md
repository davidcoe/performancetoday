Dataset and Analytics for Performance Today

I'm interested in understanding if there are underlying trends in the music played on [Performance Today with host Fred Child](https://www.yourclassical.org/performance-today). Will Bethoveen's birthday month be obvious from the data? Will important anniversaries of composers and performers stand out?
